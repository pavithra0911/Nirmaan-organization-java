        <h3><b>CAKE BAKING</b></h3>
   <p><b>Baking</b> is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an oven, but can also be done in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most common baked item is bread, but many other types of foods can be baked.[1] Heat is gradually transferred from the surface of cakes, cookies, and pieces of bread to their center, typically conducted at elevated temperatures surpassing 300Â°F. Dry heat cooking imparts a distinctive richness to foods through the processes of caramelization and surface browning. As heat travels through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center.[2] <b>Baking</b> can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other.<b> Baking</b> is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit.</p>
